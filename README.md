## Description

This project is a front-end development semester project created for my school. It is an auction house application that leverages the Noroff API to manage profiles, listings, credits, and bidding functionalities. This application showcases my skills in design, functionality, and API integration.

Key features of the project include:

- Integration with the Noroff API for handling user profiles, auction listings, and the bidding process.
- Implementation of modern front-end technologies including Vite, HTML, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

The auction house application is designed for ease of use with the following functionalities:

- **Account Creation**: Users can sign up using their noroff.no or stud.noroff.no email addresses. Upon successful registration, users are credited with 1,000 credits to start bidding.

- **Viewing Listings**: All auction listings are viewable by anyone, regardless of whether they are logged in. This allows visitors to browse through the available auctions without needing an account.

- **Creating Listings**: Registered users can create their auction listings. This feature enables users to add items to the auction pool, enhancing the marketplace's variety.

- **Deleting Listings**: Users can delete their listings, providing control and flexibility over their auction items.

- **Bidding on Auctions**: Registered users can use their credits to bid on listed auctions. Bidding is a straightforward process, and users can participate in any open auction.

- **API Limitations**: To maintain relevance and quality, the API fetch has been limited to 500 posts. This ensures that the listings primarily showcase auctions from our class and related items.
